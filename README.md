# ðŸ’° Converto-SwiftUI

Currency Converter app built with [Fixer API](https://fixer.io) which provides free exchange rates using EUR as base currency.

I have previously developed this app using UIKit but after learning SwiftUI, I wanted to put my new knowledge into practice. 

It was at first challenging to change the way I got used to think when developing apps in UIKit but this app helped me to further understand the differences between UIKit & SwiftUI.

## Project Setup

In order to run this app successfully, you will need an API Key from Fixer. If you do not have an account, you can sign up for a free API key at [fixer.io](https://fixer.io)

Clone the project and create a file under project directory and add;

``` let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY" ```

All done, you can now run the project.
